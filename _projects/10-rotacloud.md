I currently work on the backend team at RotaCloud as senior software engineer.

RotaCloud is composed of **microservices** written in **Typescript**, utilising **MySQL** and numerous **AWS** services.

My typical duties include:
* Writing, deploying and supporting production code that powers public and internal APIs
* Coaching and supporting team members
* Writing and presenting design documents, and gaining consensus with the rest of my team and other relevant teams on technical design decisions
* Working with the product team in discovery to solve customer problems
* Identifying and resolving technical problems and risks to the business

In this role, I've:
* Built an access control framework that has shortened development time and greatly reduced the risk of high-impact product defects
* Developed a tool used during a legacy monolith-to-microservices migration to detect small unintentional changes introduced when rebuilding legacy APIs, which eliminated any chance of bugs arising from the legacy migration
* Led the conversion from request-response style communication between microservices to an **event-driven architecture**, which has resolved numerous scaling and coupling problems and has had a large impact on the stability and reliability of the API
* Designed and built a system to deploy PRs to a test environment on demand, using **Kubernetes**, **EKS** and **ArgoCD**
