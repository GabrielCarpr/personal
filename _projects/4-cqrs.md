name: CQRS
github: https://github.com/gabrielcarpr/cqrs
lead: CQRS is a lightweight extendable backend framework built in **Go** centered around a command, event, and query bus.

Using code generation and packages for authentication, queued commands and events, REST, CLI, HTML or GraphQL interfaces, I can use CQRS to quickly start a new backend project where I wonâ€™t have to spend time further down the road improving architecture or scalability.
