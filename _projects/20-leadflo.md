When I started working on Leadflo, it was a very rough MVP with mountains of technical debt. Itâ€™s now a fully-fledged product with fast development and growth.

My greatest achievement on Leadflo was that I designed and led the implementation of its most ambitious feature, a marketing automation engine, and delivered it way ahead of schedule.

I previously worked on Leadflo as a full time employee, however now I give a few hours of my evenings every week in a consultative capacity in which I lead product development. I'm responsible for the product strategy, roadmap, backlog and feature definition. In this role I've supported 3x growth and achieved profitability.

Leadflo is written in **PHP** and **Typescript** using **Laravel** and **React**; is built by **CircleCI** into **Docker** containers deployed by **Terraform**; runs on **ECS**; monitored by **Prometheus**, **Alertmanager**, and **Grafana**; and uses **PostgreSQL**.
