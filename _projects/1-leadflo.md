When I started working on Leadflo, it was a very rough MVP with mountains of technical debt. Itâ€™s now a fully-fledged product with fast development and growth.

Recently, I designed and led the implementation of its most ambitious feature, an automation engine, and delivered it way ahead of schedule.

Leadflo is written in **PHP** and **Typescript** using **Laravel** and **React**, built by **CircleCI** into **Docker** containers, deployed by **Terraform**, running on **ECS**, monitored by **Prometheus**, **Alertmanager**, and **Grafana**, and uses **PostgreSQL**.
