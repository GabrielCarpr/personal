lead: Monzo-YNAB is a simple utility I built for myself that registers and receives webhooks from my [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) bank account, and converts and records them within [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), a budgeting app.

Itâ€™s been successfully running for over a year, has processed hundreds of transactions, and has had no bugs.

Monzo-YNAB is built in **Go** and runs on **Kubernetes**.
